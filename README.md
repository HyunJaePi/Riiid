# Riiid
The goal of the term project of COSI123A (Fall 2020) was to participate in a Kaggle competition, Riiid AIEd challenge and develop algorithms for knowledge tracing that can predict studentsâ€™ future performance. We developed a few new features and tested Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, and Random Forest. Although one model that we trained generated auc score 0.769 (highest score that we got), one feature in this model could not be incorporated into the test data in the competition and we could not submit the results. At the time when you wrote the final version of the report, our best score on the LeaderBoard was not posted due to Kaggle errors. However, we expect it to be over 0.77 based on auc score on validation dataset. The lessons that we learned through this term project were how to handle large dataset in a restricted condition (e.g. time & memory) and understanding Kaggle platform.
